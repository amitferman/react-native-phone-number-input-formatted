# React Native Phone Number Input with Formatting

Performance oriented React Native Phone Number Input with typings and proper validation for any country. Forked from [react-native-phone-number-input](https://github.com/garganurag893/react-native-phone-number-input).

Now with automatic as-you-type formatting! Centering is also improved compared to original version. Tested only with the "first" layout.
